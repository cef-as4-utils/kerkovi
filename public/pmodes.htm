    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

    <p>This document provides a recommendation for P-Mode
        definitions as used in operations between Minder and the system under test
        (SUT) where Minder acts as Corner 1 (C1) or Corner (4) and the SUT acts as
        Corner 2 (C2) or Corner 3 (C3) in the four corner model.</p>

    <p>This is based on the 'Messaging Model' diagram from the
        document named '<i>TestAssertians_eSENS_AS4_Draft6.docx</i>' as shown below:</p>

    <p><span><img width=303 height=177 id="Picture 1"
                  src="/pmodes_files/image001.png"
                  alt="Description: worddav248b2390374ee32f0fb3dfecafa22a0b.png"></span></p>

    <p>For the P-Mode definition considered here Minder will act as
        the <i>Message Producer</i> <i>/ Consumer</i> and the SUT is either the <i>Sending
        </i>or <i>Receiving MSH</i>. Therefor P-Modes need to be defined for the <b>Submit,
            Deliver</b> and <b>Notify</b> operations. The P-Modes that define the message
        exchanges between the MSHs is out of scope of this document.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>All P-Modes use the Push MEP binding. Because the <b>submit</b>
        operation may require a response to inform the Message Producer (Minder) on the
        <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>eb:MessageId</span>
        used in the exchange between the MSHs it uses a Two-Way MEP. Both the <b>deliver</b>
        and <b>notify</b> operation use a One-Way MEP.</p>

    <p>The <b>PartyId</b>s to use for Minder and the SUT have to be
        agreed upon between the Minder team and the vendor of the SUT.</p>

    <p>The proposed values for <b>Role</b> are as follows</p>

    <ul>
        <li>http://www.esens.eu/as4/conformancetest/testdriver for Minder</li>
        <li>http://www.esens.eu/as4/conformancetest/sut for the system under test.</li>
    </ul>


    <p><b>AgreementRef</b> is not used and must not be included in
        the messages.</p>

    <p>The <b>Service</b> value to use in all P-Modes is <i>&quot;http://www.esens.eu/as4/conformancetest&quot;</i>
        with no type attribute.</p>

    <p>No security and reliability is used between the SUT and
        Minder.</p>

    <h3 id="sampleWorkflow">Sample Workflow</h3>
    <p> A sample message flow that includes the
        journey of a message from Corner1 to Corner 4 has been given below.</p>

    <h4>Assumptions</h4>

    <p>Producer = Minder.</p>

    <p>C2: Sending MSH, which sends messages to Corner 3 (C3).</p>

    <p>C3: Receiving MSH, which receives messages and sends back
        receipts (i.e. in a ONE_WAY mep scenario).</p>

    <h4>Sequence</h4>


    <p><b>Step 1 -</b> <i>Submit</i>: Producer sends a message to C2</p>

    <p><b>Step 2 -</b> Producer receives a receipt from C2
        containing details of the producer message - the receipt back to Producer is
        optional and may just be an HTTP Response 20x</p>

    <p><b>Step 3 -</b> Send: C2 constructs a message based on
        message received from Producer and sends this to C3</p>

    <p><b>Step 4 -</b> C2 receives a receipt (or error) signal from
        C3 containing details of the C2 message</p>

    <p><b>Step 5 -</b> <i>Notify</i>: C2 constructs message
        detailing the result of the message from C2 to C3 and sends this to the
        producer</p>

    <p><b>Step 6 -</b> <i>Deliver</i>: C3 constructs message based
        on the message it received, and delivers it to C4.</p>

    <h2 id="testOperations">Test Operations</h2>

    <p>The operations associated with the three P-Modes include
        'submit', 'deliver' and 'notify'. Each operation message between Minder and the
        SUT includes a set of <i>Message Properties</i> defining the necessary
        instructions and properties for the test operation. These being as follows.</p>

    <h3 id="submit">Submit</h3>

    <p>Instruction from Minder to C2 or C3 to submit a message to
        the opposite corner (C3 or C2 respectively). Because Minder needs to know the
        ebMS MessageId that the SUT uses for the exchange with the other corner the
        submit operation consists of two legs with Minder always being the Initiator: &nbsp;<b>Initiator</b>
        = <i>Minder</i></p>

    <h4>Request leg</h4>

    <p>The request leg of the submit is the actual submission from Minder
        to the SUT. The value to use for <b>Action</b> is <i>Submit.</i></p>

    <p>In the <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>eb:</span><span
            style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>MessageProperties</span><span
            style='font-size:11.0pt'> </span>element the meta-data required for submitting the
        message from Minder to the SUT must be supplied.</p>

    <p>It is assumed that the From PartyId to use in the message to
        be sent by the MSH is fixed and does not need to be provided by Minder. The <i>originalSender</i>
        and <i>finalRecipient</i> properties must also be included in the <span
                style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>eb:MessageProperties</span> &nbsp;of
        the actual message sent by the MSH to the other MSH. </p>

    <p>Based on these message properties the SUT must be able to
        find the P-Mode to use for the message exchange with the other MSH. The P-Modes
        that define the message exchanges between the MSHs should therefore be
        sufficiently different to allow unambiguous selection of the P-Mode.</p>

    <p>The payloads included in the submit message (from Minder to
        SUT) and associated meta-data provided in <span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Courier New"'>eb:PayloadInfo</span> must also be included with the
        message sent by the SUT.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3 id="deliver">Deliver</h3>

    <p>The deliver operation is between the opposite inner corner
        SUT and Minder. I.e. C3 or C2 where C2 or C3 received the corresponding Minder
        submit operation. Initiator and action are set as follows</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Initiator </b>= SUT</p>

    <p><b>Action</b> = <i>Deliver</i></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The deliver operation is the reverse of submit, so the
        meta-data can be transferred from the SUT to Minder in the same way as in the
        submit operation.</p>

    <p>Although the deliver operation is abstract, i.e. has no
        formal specification, it is assumed that implementations are able to supply the
        specified meta-data on delivery.</p>

    <h3 id="notify">Notify</h3>

    <p>The notify operation is from the corner which received a
        Minder submit operation in case of receipt/error signal from the opposite
        corner. The aim of this operation is to inform the producer about the future
        status of a message previously submitted to the SUT. Therefore, the SUT should
        inform the producer in case a message is successfully sent to the opposite
        corner, or an error occurs during the delivery operation. In both error and
        success cases, the producer must be able to correlate the notification message
        with the previously submitted message. Therefore, the RefToMessageId field is
        required in both error and success cases. </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Additionally, an SUT does not have to notify the producer about
        an error that is not related to a previously submitted message.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Initiator</b> = SUT</p>

    <p><b>Action</b> = <i>Notify</i></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The following message properties are defined to indicate the
        corresponding message for which the Signal was received and the Signal type
        (Receipt or Error). </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The <i>RefToMessageId</i> property is optional in the case
        of an ebMS Error Signal. It must be set to the <span style='font-family:Courier'>eb:RefToMessageId</span>
        of the signal which is the eb:MessageId of the original message that was sent
        by the SUT to the opposite corner if included. </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The <i>SignalType</i> property must contain either <i>Receipt</i>
        or <i>Error</i>. In addition to the message properties the message may include
        information on the received signal as a payload.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The <i>ErrorCode</i> property should reflect the value of
        ebms error code in case of a fault message. For a <i>Receipt</i> notification
        type, this value may be empty.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The <i>ShortDescription</i> and <i>Description</i>
        properties should reflect the values of the same name (i.e. <span
