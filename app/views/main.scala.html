<p>
  Kerkovi is the e-SENS generic AS4 Conformance & Interoperability bridge that achieves connectivity between the testing system (<b>Minder Testbed</b>) and the AS4 compliant gateways.
</p>
<p>
  Kerkovi consists of three adapters (two national backend simulators and an AS4 interceptor).
  The backend adapters are capable of sending AS4 messages as backend submission messages to the AS4 gateways. They can also receive <i>delivery</i> , <i>submission result</i>  and <i>notification</i> messages.
</p>

<p>
  Kerkovi is responsible of tracking the addresses of the gateways with respect to the party ID's
  and perform forwarding of messages with respect to the addresses it resolves from the party ID's.
